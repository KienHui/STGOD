The Tsaj maintain a relatively small number of types of warship. Warship fleets are often consolidated into a single ship during transit, and will frequently stay connected in small numbers even in combat. They have the common bow is up orientation. with acceleration being in the up direction. A common feature is the central shaft, known as Broadway, allowing movement of gear and supplies internally easily. This shaft is normally broken up every couple decks by hatches, in case of depressurization. Each deck normally also has a grating across broadway, keeping falls from being a danger, excepting where lifts move through the shaft.
## General design
## Classes
### Battleship
150pts
The largest warship type. Bristles with needle casters and missile launchers. It would be incorrect to say it's equipped with point defense so much as it is literally coated with it. There is barely a square meter of surface that doesn't have a phaser panel mounted. Typical crew of 200. Often found with a pair of sloops attached to provide additional point defense capability when detached.
### Frigate
50pts
Workhorse of the fleet. Typical crew of 100. Carries a quartet of cutters.
### Carrier
0pts + 60 cutters
Although in the warship category, not actually a warship. Rather a representation of civilian cargoships pressed into service as carriers. When so used, they rapidly deploy cutters, then hyper out of the area. 
### Corvette
15 pts
Common patrol vessel, frequently found in packs.
### Sloop
5pts
Light warship, typically used for trade protection (convoy protection, anti-piracy, etc.). Often carries a pair of cutters for boarding actions, stored externally. Carries a normal crew of 8, plus crew for cutters, boarding teams, etc.
### Cutter
.5pts
The smalllest warship type. Can be used as effective spacefighters. When in that role, are remote piloted through hyperwave. In such case, the controller is either on a nearby warship, or on a nearby planet. Also, not equipped with a hyperdrive, reserving the space and weight that would be allocated for such towards reactor and shielding. Unlike large warships, when equipped as a fighter, it utilizes single shot missile launchers. Most commonly used in combat as fleet defense. Usually one man crew, with options for boarding teams as necessary.
### Aerofighter
.05pts
Not deep space capable. Instead, it provides near space and atmospheric combat capabilites. Has a distinctive delta wing with retractable canards.
