The Tsaj maintain a relatively small number of types of warship. Warship fleets are often consolidated into a single ship during transit, and will frequently stay connected in small numbers even in combat. They have the common bow is up orientation. with acceleration being in the up direction. A common feature is the central shaft, known as Broadway, allowing movement of gear and supplies internally easily. This shaft is normally broken up every couple decks by hatches, in case of depressurization. Each deck normally also has a grating across broadway, keeping falls from being a danger, excepting where lifts move through the shaft.
## General design
## Classes
### Battleship
* 45pts
* The largest warship type. Bristles with needle casters and missile launchers. It would be incorrect to say it's equipped with point defense so much as it is literally coated with it. There is barely a square meter of surface that doesn't have a phaser panel mounted. Typical crew of 120. 
### Carrier
* 45 pts
* Drone carrier. Designed for fleet combat. The drones are usually tasked with fleet defense. High automation allows squadrons of drones to be commanded rather than requiring each drone to be individually controlled.
### Frigate
* 15pts
* Workhorse of the fleet. Typical crew of 50, plus boarding crews.
### Sloop
* 5pts
* Light warship, typically used for trade protection (convoy protection, anti-piracy, etc.). Carries a normal crew of 20, plus crew for boarding teams, etc.
### Cutter
* 1.5pts
* The smalllest warship type.  Most commonly used in fleet combat as fleet defense. However, they will normally be seen in presence missions, where more firepower isn't seen as necessary. Usually four tsaj crew, with options for boarding teams as necessary.
### Stealth Cutter
* 1.5pts
* Another small warship. This is based on largely the same hull design as the regular cutter, but with modifications to massively increase the stealth capability at the expense of combat ability. In fleet combat, will be found in the forward edge of the battlespace, giving the fleet reduced latency and increased ability to resolve the true position of the opposition. Otherwise can be seen doing sigint work. If they need to shoot, something has gone horribly wrong.

## Designation
Hulls are designated with a simple hull number. This is not prefixed with any symbol for hull type. Crews will typically then name their ship, but this is entirely unofficial. Higher level units are also designated with a simple number: "3rd squadron", "5th squadron", "etc

## Organization
Ships are generally organized into 4 ship divisions, and then 2-4 divisions are assembled into a squadron.
